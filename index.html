<p>If you've scanned a QR code to get here, it's important to learn about QR code safety. QR codes can be convenient, but they can also link to malicious sources. Here are some tips to stay safe:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="warning">Do not scan QR codes found in public places</span> unless you trust the source.</li>
<li>Always verify the URL before clicking any links.</li>
<li>Use a QR code scanner that provides a preview of the URL.</li>
